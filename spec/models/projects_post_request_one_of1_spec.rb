#User API

#The User API represents all functionality that a user in Design Huddle may perform. Every API method is run in the context of a single user and requires a user-specific Access Token for authorization. The most common integration use cases consist of listing templates, creating design projects from those templates and exporting the finished designs. Read more about authentication <a target=\"_parent\" href=\"https://api.designhuddle.com#authentication\">here</a> and embedding the Design Huddle editor <a target=\"_parent\" href=\"https://api.designhuddle.com#embedding\">here</a>.
